![Gaia1.0](./IMG_2695.png)
first implementation of Gaia Protocol with 2 Nodes construction (1 sensor device, 1 blockchain on laptop- connected to the Ethereum blockchain with Plasma construction)
# Gaia Protocol Reference Implementation
## Abstract
Gaia Protocol enables the impact innovators of tomorrow to gain access and collect relevant data. By providing a turnkey IoT solution on top of a public decentralized data infrastructure.‚Äù

## Contribution
Please refer to the contribution guideline

## Project Directory
Project Contains:
1. gaia-iot-sdk: client SDK for IoT Devices.. In this first iteration we are using DHT-22 Temperature and Humidity sensor.
2. gaia-poa-chain: a blockchain running on proof of authority validator 
    - gaia-db: persistent on-disk database containing climate data
    - gaia-rootchain: Plasma smart contract to be deployed on Ethereum blockchain

for the sake of simplicity, current construction will include one datablob per
1 block, and each block will be processed in sequential order (First in, First out)

## Installation 
First, ensure that you have latest version of Node JS and NPM installed

### Installing for `Gaia Chain`
1. cd into gaia-poa-chain
2. run `npm install`

### Installing for `Gaia Plasma Contract`
1. install truffle globally via `npm install -g truffle`
1. install Ganache-cli globally via `npm install -g ganache-cli`

### Installing for `gaia-iot-sdk`
First, make sure you have DHT22 already connected to a running raspberry pi

1. you must first discover and replace the IP address of your `Gaia Chain` within the `index.js` file 
2. ssh into your pi and run `npm install` 

## Getting Started
### Deploy Plasma Contract on Testnet Blockchain
1. cd into gaia-rootchain directory
1. Run `ganache-cli --defaultBalanceEther 100000000`
2. Run following command to deploy the Plasma Contract `truffle deploy`

the Rootchain Contract should be deployed with an address shown on your console

### Running the Gaia Chain
1. cd into gaia-poa-chain
2. start the chain up by running following command `node gaia`

You should now have the Proof of Authority blockchain started on port 3000

### Running the Gaia IoT SDK 
YOU MUST BE RUNNING A PI FOR THIS TO WORK
1. cd into gaia-iot-sdk directory
2. run `sudo node submitData`

### Running simulated IoT Data
If you don't have an IoT device, you could the following command inside gaia-poa-chain: `node simulate` -- will simulate IoT streams of data from sdk
